        WELCOME TO HELL
      </h5>
      <p>
        The Crusades were a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">religious wars</a> sanctioned by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Latin Church</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">medieval period</a>. The most commonly known Crusades are the campaigns in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Eastern Mediterranean</a> aimed at recovering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Holy Land</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Islamic rule</a> but the term "Crusades" is also applied to other church-sanctioned campaigns. These were fought for a variety of reasons including the suppression of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">paganism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">heresy</a>, the resolution of conflict among rival Roman Catholic groups, or for political and territorial advantage. At the time of the early Crusades the word did not exist, only becoming the leading descriptive term around 1760.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1095 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Pope Urban II</a> called for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">First Crusade</a> in a sermon at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Council of Clermont</a>. He encouraged military support for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Byzantine Empire</a> and its Emperor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Alexios I</a>, who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Turks</a> colonising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Anatolia</a>. One of Urban's aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the Eastern Mediterranean holy sites that were under Muslim control but scholars disagree as to whether this was the primary motive for Urban or those who heeded his call. Urban's strategy may have been to unite the Eastern and Western branches of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Christendom</a>, which had been divided since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">East-West Schism</a> of 1054 and to establish himself as head of the unified Church. The initial success of the Crusade established the first four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Crusader states</a> in the Eastern Mediterranean: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">County of Edessa</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Principality of Antioch</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">County of Tripoli</a>. The enthusiastic response to Urban's preaching from all classes in Western Europe established a precedent for other Crusades. Volunteers became Crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">plenary indulgences</a> from the Church. Some were hoping for a mass ascension into heaven at Jerusalem or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">God</a>'s forgiveness for all their sins. Others participated to satisfy feudal obligations, obtain glory and honour or to seek economic and political gain.

        HELL IS REAL & THAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW
      </h5>
      <p>
        The two-century attempt to recover the Holy Land ended in failure. Following the First Crusade there were six major Crusades and numerous less significant ones. After the last Catholic outposts fell in 1291 there were no more Crusades but the gains were longer lasting in Northern and Western Europe. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Wendish Crusade</a> and those of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Archbishop of Bremen</a> brought all the North-East Baltic and the tribes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Mecklenburg</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Lusatia</a> under Catholic control in the late 12th-century. In the early 13th century the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Teutonic Order</a> created a Crusader state in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Prussia</a> and the French monarchy used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Albigensian Crusade</a> to extend the kingdom to the Mediterranean Sea. The rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Ottoman Empire</a> in the late 14th-century prompted a Catholic response which led to further defeats at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Nicopolis</a> in 1396 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Varna</a> in 1444. Catholic Europe was in chaos and the final pivot of Christian–Islamic relations was marked by two seismic events: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">fall of Constantinople</a> to the Ottomans in 1453 and a final conclusive victory for the Spanish over the Moors with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">conquest of Granada</a> in 1492. The idea of Crusading continued, not least in the form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Knights Hospitaller</a>, until the end of the 18th-century but the focus of Western European interest moved to the New World.
      </p>

        Modern historians hold widely varying opinions of the Crusaders. To some, their conduct was incongruous with the stated aims and implied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">moral authority</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">papacy</a>, as evidenced by the fact that on occasion the Pope excommunicated Crusaders. Crusaders often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">pillaged</a> as they travelled, and their leaders generally retained control of captured territory instead of returning it to the Byzantines. During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">People's Crusade</a>, thousands of Jews were murdered in what is now called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Rhineland massacres</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Constantinople was sacked</a> during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Fourth Crusade</a>. But the Crusades had a profound impact on Western civilisation: they reopened the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Mediterranean</a> to commerce and travel (enabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Genoa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Venice</a> to flourish); they consolidated the collective identity of the Latin Church under papal leadership; and they constituted a wellspring for accounts of heroism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">chivalry</a>, and piety that galvanised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">medieval romance</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">philosophy</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">literature</a>. The Crusades also reinforced the connection between Western Christendom, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">feudalism</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">militarism</a>.

    To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
